  Output: This tutorial is partly based on section 6.1 of
   "Econometrics with R" (https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/).

- Class: text
  Output:  Influences on the dependent variable which are not
   captured by the model are collected in the error term, which we so
   far assumed to be uncorrelated with the regressor. However, this
   assumption is violated if we exclude determinants of the dependent
   variable which vary with the regressor. This might induce an
   estimation bias, i.e., the mean of the OLS estimatorâ€™s sampling
   distribution is no longer equal to the true mean. In our example we
   therefore wrongly estimate the causal effect on test scores of a
   unit change in the student-teacher ratio, on average. This issue is
   called omitted variable bias (OVB).

- Class: text
  Output: Omitted variable bias is the bias in the OLS estimator that
   arises when the regressor, X  is correlated with an omitted
   variable. For omitted variable bias to occur, two conditions must
   be fulfilled. 1. X is correlated with the omitted variable and 2.
   The omitted variable is a determinant of the dependent variable Y.
   Together, 1. and 2. result in a violation of the OLS assumption
   that says that the regressors and the error term are not
   correlated.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In this tutorial we have uploaded a data set  with
   information on test performance, school characteristics and student
   demographic backgrounds for school districts in California. The
   data set is called "educ". We will work with three variables of
   this data set. "score" is the result of the a standardized test.
   "str" is the student/teacher ratio and "english" is the percentage
   of English learners. Obtain summary statistics of these three
   variables using the summary() function and giving the data frame as
   argument.
  CorrectAnswer: summary(educ)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(educ)')
  Hint: You have to enter "summary(educ)" to obtain summaries of the 3
   variables.

- Class: text
  Output: Suppose we want to understand the relation between test
   performance and student/teacher ratio. The larger this ratio,
   students could get less attention and perform worse. A highly
   relevant variable could be the percentage of English learners in the
   school district. It is plausible that the ability to speak, read and
   write English is an important factor for successful
   learning. Therefore, students that are still learning English are
   likely to perform worse in tests than native speakers. Also, it is
   conceivable that the share of English learning students is bigger in
   school districts where class sizes are relatively large. Think of
   poor urban districts where a lot of immigrants live. In these
   schools student/teacher ratio could be higher. Will the omission of
   "english" introduce a bias in the effect of student/teacher ratio
   on test performance?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The two conditions needed for this bias to occur are that
   the ommitted and included variable are correlated. Check the
   correlation between "str" and "english".
  CorrectAnswer: cor(educ$str,educ$english)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('cor(educ$str,educ$english)','cor(educ$english,educ$str)')
  Hint: You have to enter "cor(educ$str,educ$english".

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The correlation is not high, but these two variables are
   indeed correlated. The second condition is that the omitted variable
   is correlated with the dependent variable, that is that "english"
   is correlated with "score". Verify now if this second condition if
   satisfied.
  CorrectAnswer: cor(educ$score,educ$english)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('cor(educ$score,educ$english)','cor(educ$english,educ$score)')
  Hint: You have to enter "cor(educ$score,educ$english)".

- Class: text
  Output: So there should be a bias. The product of these two
   correlations gives us also the sign of the bias. Since the first
   condition implies a positive correlation and the second one a
   negative correlation, the bias is going to be negative.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If we cannot observe the omitted variable, "english", we can
   only estimate "score" on "str". Do it now.
  CorrectAnswer: lm(score~str, data=educ)
  AnswerTests:  any_of_exprs('lm(score~str, data=educ)','lm(educ$score~educ$str)')
  Hint: You have to enter "lm(score~str, data=educ)".

- Class: text
  Output: Save the value for the estimated coefficient for "str",
   -2.28. This result is telling us that the more students per
   teacher, the worse the average test result. But it could be a
   biased result according to our previous reasoning.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To obtain the bias, we also need the full regression, that
   is the regression of "score" on "str" and "english". Do it now.
  CorrectAnswer: lm(english~str+english, data=educ)
  AnswerTests:  any_of_exprs('lm(score~str+english, data=educ)','lm(score~english+str, data=educ)','lm(educ$english~educ$str+educ$english)','lm(educ$english~educ$english+educ$str)')
  Hint: You have to enter "lm(english~str+english, data=educ)".

- Class: text
  Output: Save the estimated coefficient for "english", -0.6498, since
   we going to use it later.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: The bias is simply the different between the coefficient of str when
   we omit "english" that you saved previously, and the coefficient of
   str when we include "english" in the previous regression. The bias
   is
  AnswerChoices: -1.1787; -2.28; -1.1013; -3.3813
  CorrectAnswer: -1.1787
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='-1.1787')
  Hint: The bias is -2.28 - (-1.1013) = -1.1787.

- Class: text
  Output: So the true coefficient should much lower, -1.1787, but
   omitting "english" we get a biased larger negative effect
   of -2.28. This is consistent with our first reasoning on the
   correlations, the bias is negative.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In this case we can compute the bias directly since we have
   data for the omitted variable. In general, we do not have
   information on the omitted variable, but if we can reason the size
   and direction of the two correlations mentioned previously, we can
   assess the possible size and direction of the bias. In this case,
   to assess the bias directly, we first compute a regression of the
   omitted variable (english) on the included variable (str). Do it now.
  CorrectAnswer: lm(english~str, data=educ)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('lm(english~str, data=educ)','lm(educ$english~educ$str)')
  Hint: You have to enter "lm(english~str, data=educ)".

- Class: text
  Output: Write in a separate paper the value for the coefficient for
   str, that is 1.814.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: The bias can also be shown to be equal to the coefficient of
   the auxiliary regression of "english" on "str" that you saved
   previously, multiplied to the coefficient of "english" in the full
   regression. Doing it like this, the bias is equal to
  AnswerChoices: -1.1787; -2.28; -1.1013; -3.3813
  CorrectAnswer: -1.1787
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='-1.1787')
  Hint: The bias is -0.6498  * 1.814  = -1.178737, the same value that
   we obtained before.

- Class: text
  Output: As we said previously, we cannot usually perform these
   computations to obtain the bias directly. We have just to be
   careful when we use regression analysis and think if we could
   be omitting relevant variables from our analysis. In this case, we
   can also reason on the size and direction of the bias, if we
   can assess the possible correlation of the omitted variable with
   the included variable and the dependent variable.

- Class: text
  Output: This finishes this tutorial on omitted variables, a
   potential problem that we always have to take into account when
   we use regression analysis.
