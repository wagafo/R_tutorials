  Output: In this lesson we will show different tools to perform a
   diagnosis for regressions. When you want to use regression analysis
   it is very important that you check that the main assumptions for
   the regression hold for your data. If the assumptions are violated,
   then the regression results may be completely wrong.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In this lesson we will use the "mtcars" data set which is
   avaliable in the "datasets" package. Check the contents of this
   data set using the str() function.
  CorrectAnswer: str(mtcars)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='str(mtcars)')
  Hint: Type "str(mtcars)" at the R prompt to see the contents of the
   mtcars data set.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We will fit a multiple regression with this data set. We
   will regress mpg (gas consumption measured by miles per gallon) on
   disp (displacement), hp (gross horsepower), weight (in pounds) and
   drat (rear axle ratio). This example is for exposition only. We
   will ignore the fact that this may not be a great way of modeling
   the this particular set of data! Use now the lm() function to
   fit this regression, and save the result in an object called "fit".
  CorrectAnswer: fit <- lm(mpg~disp+hp+wt+drat, data=mtcars)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='fit <- lm(mpg~disp+hp+wt+drat, data=mtcars)')
  Hint: Type "fit <- lm(mpg~disp+hp+wt+drat, data=mtcars) " at the R
   prompt to fit this regression.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter now "fit" at the R command prompt to see the results
   of the regression.
  CorrectAnswer: fit
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='fit')
  Hint: Type "fit" at the R prompt.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Choose the appropriate value for the estimated constant of
   the regression line.
  AnswerChoices: 29.148738; 0.003815; -12.41667; I haven't a clue
  CorrectAnswer: 29.148738
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='29.148738')
  Hint: Check the value under "Intercept".

- Class: text
  Output: R has extensive graphical and numerical tools to test if the
   assumptions for the regression are valid for this data set or are
   violated. We will first check the graphical tools. A basic
   assumption of linear regression is that the relationship is indeed
   linear. To check this, a very useful tool is the residual plot,
   which plots the residuals against the fitted value of the
   regression.

- Class: figure
  Output: The scatterplot allows also to identify outliers. Outliers are
   cases with a large different with respect to the mean of either variable
   or both. We have marked the outliers for you in the scatterplot. We have
   also plotted a horizontal line equal to the mean of the final, and a
   vertical line equal to the mean of the midterm.
